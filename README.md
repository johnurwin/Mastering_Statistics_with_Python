# Mastering Statistics with Python

Welcome to the Mastering Statistics in Python repository! This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts and notebooks covering a range of statistical topics. 
Each script provides code examples and visualizations to enhance your understanding of various statistical concepts using Python.
This repository is a resource for learning and applying statistical concepts using the Python programming language. 

The first python script added to this repository aims to explore and analyze statistical properties of various probability distributions. It generates random samples from different distributions and organizes them into multiple columns in a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis. Then it covers central tendency measures and generates histograms to visualize means and medians.

Future scripts will cover topics such as probability distributions, measures of spread, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and more.
