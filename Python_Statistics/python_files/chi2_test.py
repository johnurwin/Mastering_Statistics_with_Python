# chi-square test for independence. This test is appropriate when you have categorical data and you want to
# assess whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
# Suppose we want to know whether Competitor Presence is associated with the probability of a store visitor making a purchase.
# The null hypothesis is that thereâ€™s no association between the variables.

# Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between Competitor Presence and the probability of making a purchase.
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is an association between Competitor Presence and the probability of making a purchase.

# Is there an association between competitors in the area and purchases?

# 1. The observations should be independently randomly sampled from the population
# 2. The categories of both variables must be mutually exclusive
# 3. The groups should be independent
